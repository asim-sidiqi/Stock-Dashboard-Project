# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About Project

The Stock Dashboard is a sleek and intuitive web application designed to provide real-time insights into the stock market. Built with React.js and styled with Tailwind CSS, this project leverages the Finnhub API to deliver accurate and up-to-date stock data.

## Key Features

Real-Time Data: Stay updated with the latest stock prices and market trends.

Interactive Charts: Visualize stock performance with dynamic and interactive charts.

Customizable Watchlist: Create and manage a personalized watchlist of your favorite stocks.

News Integration: Get the latest news and updates related to your tracked stocks.

Dark Mode: Switch between light and dark themes for a comfortable viewing experience at any time of the day.

Responsive Design: Enjoy a consistent experience across all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

## Technology Stacks

React.js: A powerful front-end library for creating an interactive user interface.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

Finnhub API: A comprehensive stock API providing real-time data and financial information.

## Objective

The goal of the Stock Dashboard project is to simplify the process of monitoring and analyzing stock market data. Whether you're a seasoned investor or just getting started, this application provides all the tools you need to make informed decisions.

Explore the Stock Dashboard and take control of your investments with ease and efficiency!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
